- HIERARCHY RENDERING ORDER
    In the hierarchy panel, when you make a 2D, the objects will be rendered from top to bottom.
Which means: the objects that are further down will show up above the ones on top.
If you're making a 3D game, you don't need to worry about sorting these,
since the rendering order will depend on the camera's current position.

- UPDATE VS FIXED UPDATE
    Update runs once per frame, fixed update runs once per every physics change.
As implied, you should use fixed update when working with physics.
